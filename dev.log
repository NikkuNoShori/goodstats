## Initial State
- Dashboard component was broken
- Image loading inconsistent
- Multiple linter errors
- React Router warnings
- Unnecessary re-fetches

## Changes Made
1. Component Structure Restoration
   - Restored basic imports and interfaces
   - Implemented BookCard component with proper image handling
   - Added fallback display for failed image loads
   - Implemented main Dashboard component

2. Data Management
   - Restored Supabase integration
   - Implemented React Query for data fetching
   - Added proper error handling
   - Added loading states

3. UI Improvements
   - Added sorting functionality
   - Added filtering by shelf
   - Added search functionality
   - Added stats overview
   - Implemented responsive grid layout

4. Image Loading Strategy
   - Using OpenLibrary as primary source
   - Added Google Books as fallback
   - Implemented error handling
   - Added loading states

## Current Issues
1. Image Loading
   - Need to implement image URL caching
   - Consider adding retry mechanism
   - Monitor 404 errors from OpenLibrary

2. Performance
   - Need to implement pagination
   - Consider implementing infinite scroll
   - Optimize re-renders

3. Data Management
   - Need to implement Goodreads sync
   - Add better error handling for sync process
   - Add progress indicators

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Implement pagination
2. [ ] Add image URL caching
3. [ ] Add Goodreads sync functionality
4. [ ] Implement proper logging
5. [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Debug Notes
- Monitor network requests for image loading
- Track unnecessary re-renders
- Log failed image loads
- Track sync progress

## Performance Considerations
1. Image Loading
   - Cache successful URLs
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Use proper image sizes

2. Data Fetching
   - Implement pagination
   - Cache query results
   - Optimize query parameters

3. UI Performance
   - Memoize filtered results
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Use virtualization for large lists
