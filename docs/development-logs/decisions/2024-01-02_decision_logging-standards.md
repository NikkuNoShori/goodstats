# Development Logging Standards

## Status
- Date: 2024-01-02
- Status: Approved and Enhanced
- Deciders: Development Team

## Context
Need for systematic documentation of development decisions, changes, and issues while keeping the codebase lightweight and maintainable, with clear tracking of change origins and automated logging processes.

## Decision
Implement a structured logging system with the following rules:

### 1. Required Metadata
Every log entry must include:
- Date
- Status (requires explicit user approval for changes)
- Change Requestor
- Implementation Owner
- Priority Level (P0-P3)
- Related Changes (for tracking cause-effect)

### 2. Status Management
#### Status Change Rules:
- All status changes require explicit user approval
- Status changes must be documented with:
  - Requestor of change
  - Reason for change
  - Verification steps completed
- Intermediate status updates allowed:
  - "In Progress"
  - "Under Review"
  - "Pending Verification"
- Final status changes (e.g., "Resolved", "Completed") require:
  - User verification
  - User explicit approval
  - Documentation of approval

#### Archival Rules:
- No documentation may be archived until:
  - Final status is approved by user
  - All verification steps are completed
  - All related changes are also verified
  - User explicitly approves archival
- Archival Process:
  - Submit archival request to user
  - Receive explicit approval
  - Document archival decision
  - Move to appropriate archive location
- Temporary Storage:
  - Keep all in-progress documentation in active directories
  - Maintain working copies until final verification
  - Track dependencies between related documents

### 2. When to Create Logs

#### Required Log Creation (Automated):
- New feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Architecture decisions
- Breaking changes
- Performance improvements
- Security updates
- Dependency updates
- API changes

#### Optional Log Creation (Manual):
- Minor style changes
- Documentation updates
- Non-functional refactoring

### 3. Automated Logging Triggers
System will automatically create/update logs on:
- New feature initiation
- PR creation/merge
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Security alerts
- Performance degradation
- API changes

### 4. Log Categories and Usage

#### Instructions (`/docs/instructions/`)
- **Purpose**: Track feature implementation plans
- **Required Fields**: 
  - Requestor information
  - Business justification
  - Priority level
- **When**: Auto-created at feature initiation
- **Template**: Use `template.md`
- **Archive**: Auto-archived upon completion

#### Technical (`/docs/development-logs/technical/`)
- **Purpose**: Implementation details
- **Format**: Concise, focused on technical aspects
- **Include**: 
  - Code examples
  - Schemas
  - Patterns
  - Performance impacts

#### Decisions (`/docs/development-logs/decisions/`)
- **Purpose**: Architecture and design choices
- **Format**: Context, decision, consequences
- **Include**: 
  - Alternatives considered
  - Stakeholder inputs
  - Risk assessment

#### Issues (`/docs/development-logs/issues/`)
- **Purpose**: Bug tracking and resolution
- **Format**: Problem, investigation, solution
- **Include**: 
  - Impact assessment
  - Prevention measures
  - Affected systems

#### Features (`/docs/development-logs/features/`)
- **Purpose**: Feature development progress
- **Format**: Milestones, challenges, outcomes
- **Include**: 
  - Testing notes
  - Feedback
  - Performance metrics

### 5. Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Concise**
   - Use bullet points
   - Focus on key information
   - Avoid redundancy
   - Include only relevant data

2. **Include Context**
   - Reference related issues/PRs
   - Link to relevant documentation
   - Mention impacted components
   - Track dependencies

3. **Document Decisions**
   - Explain rationale
   - Note alternatives considered
   - List trade-offs
   - Include stakeholder input

## Automation Commitment
As an AI assistant, I commit to:
1. Automatically create appropriate logs for all significant changes
2. Track and update logs at key milestones
3. Maintain cross-references between related logs
4. Keep documentation concise and relevant
5. Alert users when manual input is needed
6. Clean up obsolete or redundant documentation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Traceable development history
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Knowledge preservation
- Easier onboarding
- Better decision tracking
- Automated documentation maintenance

### Negative
- Initial setup overhead
- Need for periodic automation review
- Risk of over-documentation

## Compliance
All changes must have:
1. Clear requestor tracking
2. Appropriate log entries
3. Cross-referenced documentation
4. Status updates at key milestones
5. Impact assessment
6. Priority classification

## Enforcement
- Automated log creation and updates
- PR reviews must verify logging compliance
- Regular documentation audits
- Template compliance checks
- Automated cleanup of obsolete logs 

### 2. Cause-Effect Tracking
#### Required for all changes:
- Initial Trigger (originating change)
- Cascading Effects (impacted systems)
- Dependency Chain (related components)

#### Impact Documentation:
- Direct Effects (immediate changes)
- Indirect Effects (downstream impacts)
- System Dependencies (affected services)

#### Resolution Tracking:
- Issue Origins
- Fix Dependencies
- Verification Steps
- Cross-feature Testing
